# DA-Repository
This repository showcases a collection of my data visualization projects created using Power BI and Tableau. Each project is built around real-world or publicly available datasets and focuses on extracting meaningful insights through interactive dashboards. From sales performance and customer segmentation to social media metrics and even a Pok√©mon stats analysis, these projects highlight my ability to clean, model, and visualize data effectively. I've used a range of tools like slicers, filters, KPIs, maps, and drill-downs to create user-friendly dashboards that help in decision-making. All files, including datasets, project files, and screenshots, are included to provide a complete overview. This portfolio reflects my skills in transforming raw data into impactful visual stories and my passion for making data simple and insightful.
